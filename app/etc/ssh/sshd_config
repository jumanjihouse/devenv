# The local strategy for options in sshd_config is to
# remove commented lines when we override values.
# This strategy is intended to...
#
# * Promote unique lines in the config to
#   avoid accidental conflicts or duplicates.
# * Promote clarity.
#
# The upstream strategy for options in sshd_config
# shipped with OpenSSH is to...
#
# * Specify options with their default value where possible,
#   but leave them commented.
# * Uncommented options change a default value.

# CCE-14491-5 Use appropriate ciphers for SSH
# NIST 800-53 mapping: SC-13
#
# Enforce the use of ciphers which are FIPS-approved.
#
# The default is:
#   aes128-ctr,aes192-ctr,aes256-ctr,arcfour256,arcfour128,
#   aes128-cbc,3des-cbc,blowfish-cbc,cast128-cbc,aes192-cbc,
#   aes256-cbc,arcfour
#
# Recommended:
#   aes128-ctr,aes192-ctr,aes256-ctr
#
# Symmetric ciphers are used to encrypt the data after the initial
# key exchange and authentication is complete.

# Specifies the maximum amount of data that

# followed a maximum amount of time that may pass before the session key is renegotiated.
#
# The first argument is specified in bytes and may have a suffix of 'K', 'M', or 'G'
# to indicate Kilobytes, Megabytes, or Gigabytes, respectively.
# The default is between '1G' and '4G', depending on the cipher.
#
# The optional second value is specified in seconds and
# may use any of the units documented in the TIME FORMATS section.
# The default value for RekeyLimit is "default none", which means that
# rekeying is performed after the cipher’s default amount of data has been sent or received and
# no time based rekeying is done.
#
# NOTE: rekeylimit currently requires a workaround for upstream sshd (< v7.6).

# CCE-4475-0 Disable emulation of the rsh command through the ssh server
# NIST 800-53 mapping: SC-7
#
# Prevent SSH from emulating the behavior of the obsolete rsh
# command, which would allow users to enable insecure access to
# their accounts via .rhosts files.
#
# Don't read the user's ~/.rhosts and ~/.shosts files
#
# The default is 'yes'.

# CCE-3845-5 idle timeout interval should be set to an appropriate value
# NIST 800-53 mapping: CM-7, AC-11
#
# Per CCE: An idle user should be automatically logged out after 5 minutes of inactivity.
# This prevents the system from keeping open ssh connections that are not being used.

# The default is 0, indicating that these messages will not be sent to the client.

# Recommended by CCE: 900
#

# CCE-14061-6 'keep alive' message count should be set to an appropriate value.
# NIST 800-53 mapping: SC-10
#
# Per CCE: An idle user should be automatically logged out after 5 minutes of inactivity.
# This prevents the system from keeping open ssh connections that are not being used.
#
# The client alive mechanism is valuable when the client or server
# depend on knowing when a connection has become inactive.
# If ClientAliveInterval (see above) is set to 15, and
# ClientAliveCountMax is left at the default, unresponsive SSH
